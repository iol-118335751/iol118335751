                  Music is one of my main interests and biggest passion. There is never a day when I dont listen to music. Even when I was little I would always be playing the msuic channels on sky, browsing through differnt genres of music and identifying my favourite artists. My favourite genres of music are hip-hop, alternative and eletronic. I will be attending my first concert in June, I will be seeing Lana Del Rey in Malahide Castle in Dublin.
