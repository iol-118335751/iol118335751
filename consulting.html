                  A blockchain carries no transaction cost. (An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner. One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block. This block is verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers distributed around the net. The verified block is added to a chain, which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record, but a unique record with a unique history. Falsifying a single record would mean falsifying the entire chain in millions of instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for monetary transactions, but it can be deployed in many others ways. Modern technology allows people to communicate directly, voice and video calls, emails, picture and instant messages travel directly from a to b maintaining trust between people no matter how far apart the are. When it comes to money people have to trust a third party to complete the transaction. Blockchain technology is challenging the status quo in a radical way, by using math and cryptography blockchain provides and open decentralised database of every transaction involving value, money goods, property, work and even votes, creating a record whos authenticity can be verified by the entire community. The future global economy will move towards one of distributed property and trust where anyone with access to the internet can get involved in blockchain based transactions and third party trust organisations will no longer be needed, The uses of blockchain technology are endless some expect in less than 10  years it will be used to collect taxes, it will make it easier for immigrants to send money back to countries where access to financial institutions are limited, financial fraud will be significantly reduced as every transaction will be recorded on a public and distributed ledger which will be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Blockchain will become a global decentralised source of trust

			  What is autonomy? Autonomy is the ability to make your own decisions. In humans, autonomy allows us to do the most meaningful, not to mention meaningless, tasks. This includes things like walking, talking, waving, opening doors, pushing buttons and changing light bulbs. In robots, autonomy is really no different.

Autonomous robots, just like humans, also have the ability to make their own decisions and then perform an action accordingly. A truly autonomous robot is one that can perceive its environment, make decisions based on what it perceives and/or has been programmed to recognize and then actuate a movement or manipulation within that environment. With respect to mobility, for example, these decision-based actions include but are not limited to the following basics: starting, stopping, and maneuvering around obstacles that are in their way. he emergence of autonomous things over the last few years has been an exciting development within technology that is only going to become more innovative and more and more exciting as time goes on. Driven by the likes of big data, AI and cloud technologies, I have no doubt that – as these technologies advance – autonomous things are only going to continue to advance at a break neck speed.Autonomous vehicles are constantly collecting data from their environment; such as the road conditions, potential hazards, pedestrians, surrounding vehicles and even storing the routes and roads themselves. In order for these vehicles to become safer they rely on a vast amounts of software and the collection of vast amounts of data to train the artificial intelligence to ensure the safety of their passengers without humans having to intervene. I have read a stat that says these vehicles exchange around 15,000 pieces of data within a tenth of a second, this is a figure that could rise to 200,000 pieces of data by 2020.

			   The definition of virtual reality comes, naturally, from the definitions for both ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. The definition of ‘virtual’ is near and reality is what we experience as human beings. So the term ‘virtual reality’ basically means ‘near-reality’. This could, of course, mean anything but it usually refers to a specific type of reality emulation. We know the world through our senses and perception systems. In school we all learned that we have five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing. These are however only our most obvious sense organs. The truth is that humans have many more senses than this, such as a sense of balance for example. These other sensory inputs, plus some special processing of sensory information by our brains ensures that we have a rich flow of information from the environment to our minds. Until recently, virtual reality had been something of a fantasy for storytellers and technologists. Everything that we know about our reality comes by way of our senses. In other words, our entire experience of reality is simply a combination of sensory information and our brains sense-making mechanisms for that information. It stands to reason then, that if you can present your senses with made-up information, your perception of reality would also change in response to it. You would be presented with a version of reality that isn’t really there, but from your perspective it would be perceived as real. Something we would refer to as a virtual reality. Although we talk about a few historical early forms of virtual reality elsewhere on the site, today virtual reality is usually implemented using computer technology. There are a range of systems that are used for this purpose, such as headsets, omni-directional treadmills and special gloves. These are used to actually stimulate our senses together in order to create the illusion of reality.

This is more difficult than it sounds, since our senses and brains are evolved to provide us with a finely synchronised and mediated experience. If anything is even a little off we can usually tell. This is where you’ll hear terms such as immersiveness  and realism enter the conversation. These issues that divide convincing or enjoyable virtual reality experiences from jarring or unpleasant ones are partly technical and partly conceptual. Virtual reality technology needs to take our physiology into account. For example, the human visual field does not look like a video frame. We have (more or less) 180 degrees of vision and although you are not always consciously aware of your peripheral vision, if it were gone you’d notice.
